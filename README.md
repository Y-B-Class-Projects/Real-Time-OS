# Real-Time-OS

This exercise uses the SMART OS.

> SMART is a basic real-time OS for managing asynchronous parallel processes that handles Clock interrupts, Hardware interrupts, BIOS, Time management, Scheduler, Contex switch and Critical sections.

------------

In this exercise we added features to SMART.

The added features:
- Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduler.
- Rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS) scheduler.
- Priority mutex.
- Atomic sections.
- Critical sections (using the local flag method, as implemented in the VxWorks OS).
